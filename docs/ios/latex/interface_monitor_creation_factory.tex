\subsection{Detailed Description}
This class is a factory. The purpose is to use polymorphic behavior in the creation of the device classes without the calling class having to know the details. The setup details are in the create\-From\-Peripheral method.

N\-O\-T\-E\-: In order to add more devices to this application the following must be done.


\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item A class for that device must be created.
\item The class must at a minimum follow and implement the methods in the \hyperlink{protocol_device_common_info_interface-p}{Device\-Common\-Info\-Interface} protocol.
\item If the device does heart monitoring it must use the methods in the \hyperlink{protocol_heart_monitor_protocol-p}{Heart\-Monitor\-Protocol}.
\item If the device does activity monitoring it must use the methods in the \hyperlink{protocol_activity_monitor_protocol-p}{Activity\-Monitor\-Protocol}.
\item The +(id$<$\-Device\-Common\-Info\-Interface$>$) create\-From\-Peripheral\-: (C\-B\-Peripheral$\ast$) peripheral must be updated
\end{DoxyEnumerate}

This class is a device object factory to centralize creation and reduce dependency complexities as much as possible.

Creates a device object based on the peripheral supplied. There are a few assumptions. The first assumption is that there is a class for the type of device to be created. The second assumption is that this method properly identifies the type of device that fits the class and finally that the class is in the import section above this comment. This method does N\-O\-T always produce an object and so a check to see if the return is nil is needed. This is to prevent the false positives sometimes created from the scanning process.


\begin{DoxyParams}{Parameters}
{\em peripheral} & is the device bluetooth device peripheral object that is passed from the device manager. \\
\hline
\end{DoxyParams}
\begin{DoxyReturn}{Returns}
The return is an object of the class that fits in the \hyperlink{protocol_device_common_info_interface-p}{Device\-Common\-Info\-Interface} protocol. All devices must follow the protocol for proper utilization and to prevent runtime crashes. The return value must be checked for nil cases. 
\end{DoxyReturn}
