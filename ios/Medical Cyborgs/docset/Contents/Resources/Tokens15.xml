			<Abstract type="html">This class is a factory.  The purpose is to use polymorphic behavior in the creation
of the device classes without the calling class having to know the details.  The setup
details are in the createFromPeripheral method.</Abstract>

			<Abstract type="html">Creates a device object based on the peripheral supplied.  There are a few assumptions.
The first assumption is that there is a class for the type of device to be created.  The
second assumption is that this method properly identifies the type of device that fits the class
and finally that the class is in the import section above this comment.  This method does NOT
always produce an object and so a check to see if the return is nil is needed.  This is to
prevent the false positives sometimes created from the scanning process.</Abstract>

				<Parameter>
					<Name>peripheral</Name>
					<Abstract type="html">is the device bluetooth device peripheral object that is passed from the device
manager.</Abstract>
				</Parameter>
			</Parameters>
			<ReturnValue><Abstract type="html">The return is an object of the class that fits in the DeviceCommonInfoInterface protocol.
All devices must follow the protocol for proper utilization and to prevent runtime crashes.
The return value must be checked for nil cases.</Abstract></ReturnValue>
